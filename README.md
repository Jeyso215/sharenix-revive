ShareNix is a ShareX clone for Linux and FreeBSD. It features image/screenshot
and file uploading to almost any file/image sharing service that has an
API thanks to the easily customizable json configuration.

ShareNix is somewhat compatible with ShareX's json config format.
If you're a ShareX user, you can easily import your settings by pasting
them in the Services section of sharenix.json

this was one of my first golang projects. don't expect good code

the project is mostly in mainteinance mode. I don't have interest in developing it further as I have
been moving to a minimal setup with just a shell script to upload screenshots. but I don't mind
pushing small improvements here and there

Installing - Arch Linux
============
if you use arch linux, there's an aur package that compiles and installs
the latest version of ShareNix for you:

```
pacman -S --needed base-devel
pacman -S git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/sharenix-git.git
cd sharenix-git
makepkg -si
```

customize your config by copying /etc/sharenix.json to ~/.sharenix.json and editing it

Installing - Void Linux
============
```
sudo xbps-install sharenix scrot
```

customize your config by copying /etc/sharenix.json to ~/.sharenix.json
and editing it

Installing - Prebuilt binaries
============
download the latest release from https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix/releases

```bash
tar xvf sharenix-*.tar.xz

sudo cp sharenix-*/sharenix /usr/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/sharenix
sudo cp sharenix-*/src/sharenix-section /usr/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/sharenix-section
sudo cp sharenix-*/src/sharenix-window /usr/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/sharenix-window 

cp sharenix-*/sharenix.json ~/.sharenix.json
sharenix -h
```

Usage
============
* ```sharenix -h``` for a list of available options
* ```sharenix-section``` to select a region and upload it
* ```sharenix-window``` to screenshot a window and upload it

You can now set-up sharenix any way you like: bind it to hotkeys,
launch it from your terminal, and so on.

Check out the sharenix.json config file for the example configuration.
I might document the config format some day, but the behaviour is nearly
the same as ShareX so you could just read through
[this section](https://getsharex.com/docs/custom-uploader) of
the ShareX guide. ShareNix supports most of the json syntax.

sharenix.json locations, from highest to lowest priority:

```
~/.sharenix.json
(base path to sharenix's executable)/sharenix.json
/etc/sharenix.json
/usr/local/etc/sharenix.json
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sharenix/sharenix.json
~/.config/sharenix/sharenix.json
```

The first config file that is found, starting from top to bottom, will be used.

Notifications and canceling uploads
============
Using the -n flag will enable notifications for uploads in the bottom right
corner of your screen.

Right-clicking a "upload in progress" notification will cancel the upload and
dismiss the notification.

Right-click a "upload completed" notification will dimiss it, while left
clicking the url will open it in your default browser.

If for whatever reason notification positions get buggy, reset the locks by running:

```
rm ~/sharenix/.notify*
```

Screenshotting areas or windows
============
Until window and area grabbing are built into sharenix, you can use pretty
much any screenshotting tool and pass its image to sharenix.

If you have xfce4-screenshooter, you can use
```xfce4-screenshooter -r -o "sharenix -n"``` for regions and
```xfce4-screenshooter -w -o "sharenix -n"``` for windows.

As a more generic solution, I have written two glue scripts
that query xfce4-screenshooter, gnome-screenshot and scrot and automatically
pass the result to sharenix for uploading. if you followed the install
instructions, they should already be installed.

Now you can bind these scripts to hotkeys using whatever configuration
your DE/Window Manager has.

DWM example config (edit ```config.h``` and recompile dwm):
```c
char const* sharenix2cmd[] = { "sharenix", "-n", "-c", "-m=fs", 0 };
char const* sharenix3cmd[] = { "sharenix-window", 0 };
char const* sharenix4cmd[] = { "sharenix-section", 0 };
char const* sharenix5cmd[] = { "sharenix", "-n", "-c", "-m=c", 0 };
Key keys[] = {
    { ControlMask|ShiftMask, XK_2, spawn, {.v = sharenix2cmd } },
    { ControlMask|ShiftMask, XK_3, spawn, {.v = sharenix3cmd } },
    { ControlMask|ShiftMask, XK_4, spawn, {.v = sharenix4cmd } },
    { ControlMask|ShiftMask, XK_5, spawn, {.v = sharenix5cmd } },
    /* ... */
```

JWM example config (```~/.jwmrc```):
```xml
<Key mask="CS" key="2">exec:sharenix -m="fs" -n -o</Key>
<Key mask="CS" key="3">exec:/path/to/sharenix-window</Key>
<Key mask="CS" key="4">exec:/path/to/sharenix-section</Key>
<Key mask="CS" key="5">exec:sharenix -m="c" -n</Key>
<Key mask="CS" key="i">exec:sharenix -m="c" -n -s="twitter (gweet)"</Key>
```

i3wm example config (```~/.i3/config```):
```
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+2 exec sharenix -m="fs" -n -o
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+3 exec /path/to/sharenix-window
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+4 exec /path/to/sharenix-section
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+5 exec sharenix -m="c" -n
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+i exec sharenix -m="c" -s="twitter" -n
```

fluxbox example config (```~/.fluxbox/keys```):
```
Control Shift 2 :Exec sharenix -m="fs" -n -o
Control Shift 3 :Exec /path/to/sharenix-window
Control Shift 4 :Exec /path/to/sharenix-section
Control Shift 5 :Exec sharenix -m="c" -n
Control Shift i :Exec sharenix -m="c" -n -s="twitter (gweet)"
```

On ubuntu and similar distros, you can bind them to hotkeys in CompizConfig
Settings Manager under commands

Getting started - Building from the source
============
NOTE: this codebase is quite outdated (it was written back in go 1.4 or
something like that). I don't plan on refactoring the code for now. If you
encounter issues while trying to compile it, please downgrade to go 1.7.1 or earlier.

Before we start building ShareNix, you will need to set up a few dependencies.
* Get the dev headers for glib, cairo, pango and gtk2. On debian-ubuntu
  you just need to install libgtk2.0-dev
* Make sure that you have go >=1.3.1

It should be possible to automatically get all the dependencies
by simply running:

```
go get github.com/Francesco149/sharenix
```

If you get any errors, try getting the dependencies individually:

```
go get github.com/mattn/go-gtk/gtk
go get github.com/BurntSushi/xgb
go get mvdan.cc/xurls
go get github.com/ChrisTrenkamp/goxpath
go get github.com/Francesco149/jsonpath
go get github.com/kardianos/osext
go get github.com/Francesco149/sharenix
```

You can also manually clone the repository anywhere you want by running

    git clone https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix.git

To build sharenix, simply run

    go install github.com/Francesco149/sharenix

and copy the default config file to $GOPATH/bin

    cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/Francesco149/sharenix/sharenix.json $GOPATH/bin/sharenix.json

then run it (in this example I'm going to be uploading a full-screen screenshot
to the default site)

    cd $GOPATH/bin
    ./sharenix -m=fs

Example: Upload to your personal imgur account
============
this is a temporary solution until there's proper oauth support built in

visit [this page](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=b972ecca954f246&response_type=token)
and authorize the application. It will redirect you to the homepage of imgur,
but with a token in the URL

the URL will look like

```
https://imgur.com/#access_token=something&... (other stuff we don't care about)
```

you want the value of access_token ("something" in this example).

the config is the exact same as the anonymous imgur upload except that instead
of the Client-ID you have ```Bearer something``` where "something" is your
access_token.

```
        {
            "Name": "imgur.com (account)",
            "RequestType": "POST",
            "Headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer something"
            },
            "RequestURL": "https://api.imgur.com/3/image",
            "FileFormName": "image",
            "Arguments": {
                "type": "file"
            },
            "ResponseType": "Text",
            "URL": "$json:data.link$",
            "DeletionURL": "https://imgur.com/delete/$json:data.deletehash$"
        },
```

this works fine, however the access token will expire after about 1 month and
you will need to repeat the procedure to acquire a new one.

this will be fixed when proper OAuth handling is implemented.

Example: upload to OwnCloud webdav
============
the default config file already has an example that uploads to the demo instance

all you have to do is change username, password and url

```
        {
            "Name": "owncloud (demo)",
            "RequestType": "PUT",
            "RequestURL": "https://demo.owncloud.org/remote.php/webdav/$Y$-$M$-$D$_$h$-$m$-$s$_$n$$extension$",
            "Username": "test",
            "Password": "test",
            "ResponseType": "RedirectionURL"
        }
```

The URLs don't persist in the clipboard!
============
First of all, make sure you have a clipboard manager installed and started,
such as [parcellite](http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/) or
[clipmenu](https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu) . On linux, the clipboard
will only persist if there's a clipboard daemon grabbing all newly copied
data.

If you're running sharenix without a notification, it will hang for a couple
seconds to make sure that a clipboard manager can have a chance to grab
the URL. If you don't like the defaults, you can adjust it in
```sharenix.json``` by changing ```ClipboardTime``` . This value is in
seconds and can be fractional.

If you don't want to use a clipboard manager or all else fails, you can
pipe the URL into xclip or anything else like so:

```sh
$ sharenix -q -c=0 /path/to/my/file | xclip -i -sel cli
```

xclip will fork into a background process to keep the URL around until
something grabs ownership of it.

Customize archive folder
============
sharenix.json contains a SaveFolder field which is relative to your
home folder. that's the base folder for your archived files and history csv
which defaults to "sharenix"

if SaveFolder starts with a leading "/" it will be considered an absolute path

you can also enable "OrganizedFolders" which will organize your files into
folders for each month named like "2019-02"

Plugins
============
Sharenix has a very early form of plugins as of 0.3.0a. Feel free to contact me
if you wrote a plugin and want it in this list, but be advised that the plugin
specification is still subject to changes.
* [gweet: Upload to twitter](https://github.com/Francesco149/gweet)

Using a Plugin
============
Plugins come as one executable but might also include some extra files.

Plugin authors are highly advised to provide specific install instructions for
their plugin. I will however provide generic guidelines in this section that
will usually apply to every plugin to a certain extent.

To install a plugin, all you have to do is copy all the plugin's files to
```~/sharenix/plugins```. If the plugins directory doesn't exist, create it.

The plugin authors should always provide an example sharenix.json config entry,
or at least a list of parameters you can use. For a generic example of a config
entry, see the last step of "Writing a Plugin".

Writing a Plugin
============
Sharenix has a very early and basic plugin system that might be subject to
changes as the development progress.
* Each plugin is a stand-alone executable that will be placed in the
  ~/sharenix/plugins directory.
* The last line of the combined stdout & stderr output is used and parsed as
  the plugin's output.
* Command-line parameters must be [go-style](https://golang.org/pkg/flag).
* The plugin will recieve the sharenix.json Arguments list as command-line
  parameters. Additionally, a special _tail parameter can be used to append
  anonymous arguments at the end of the argument list.
* The sharenix.json config entry should have this format:
  ```json

    {
        "Name": "My Awesome Plugin!",
        "RequestType": "PLUGIN",
        "RequestURL": "executable-name",
        "FileFormName": "",
        "Arguments": {
            "_tail": "$input$",
            "foo": "bar",
            "someflag": "true"
        },
        "ResponseType": "Text",
        "RegexList": [],
        "URL": "",
        "ThumbnailURL": "",
        "DeletionURL": ""
    },

    ```

    which will call executable-name like so:
    ```bash

    executable-name -foo=bar -someflag=true /path/to/file or http://url/to/shorten

    ```

I am well aware that this plugin system lacks security, but defending yourself
from malicious plugins is not hard. Avoid non-opensource plugins at all costs
and if in doubt, ask someone to check a plugin's code or check it yourself.
